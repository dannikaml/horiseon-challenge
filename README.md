# Code Refactor Starter Code
***
The basis of this project is to refactor an existing code so that it meets accessibility standards and to improve the code for long-term sustainability. 


## General Info
***
The goal of this project is to meet accessibility standards. To do that we must:
* Use semantic HTML elements. 
* The HTML elements follow logical structure
* Use accessible alt attributes for images
* The heading attributes fall in sequential order
 
## Refactored Starter Code & Basic Changes to the HTML
***
The HTML portion of this starter code was essentially made up of < divs >. The first changes were to identify the header, main, body, and footer of the code and give them semantic identities. The HTML tag < section > was often used to achieve this. An alt attribute has been added after each image for accessibility standard purposes. And condensing of spaces and lines took place so that the code presented clearer and follows a structured format.

## Refactored Starter Code & Basic Changes to the CSS
***
The stylesheet was condensed from multiple parents or containers from, often three seperate identifiers, into one as they contained the same info. Portions of the Stylesheet is reordered so that all mains, headers, body's, and footer are in order and with their "families". For example, all .benefit "-lead" "-brand" "-cost" ect. are now .benefit-all; so that all can be represented concisly, as they all contain the same margin and color. The same is also applied to the class from main to "main-content". The Stylesheet and its properties are alphabetized. 

## Accessibility 
***
In this case, the added alt attributes after each image are great for screen readers. However, it is my opinion that the images might not be necessary long-term or worth explaining as they do not explicitly represent the importance of each key header and/or the paragraph containing the more important information. In any case, the point of the project is to meet accessiblity standards and therefore the alt attribute are added.
